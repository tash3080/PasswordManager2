PasswordManager Class 
done 1. Remove the individual Button child class fields (as this is poor design if you are using polymorphism).

done 2. Then in the constructor, just add the new object into the list instead. 

done 3. You may need to update some more of the code as well for this.

done 4. You could update this class to add a 'GetButton' method that get's the Button object from the list using the caption string, 
     then stores it in a local variable in the respective method to access the data specific to that Button. 

done 5. You might also need some readonly properties in the Button class or child classes.

done 6. please include a UML class diagram of your finalised code in the pdf document.
